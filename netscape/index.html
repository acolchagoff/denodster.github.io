		<h1>Attempt to Build Mozilla in sheepshaver.</h1>
		<p>Due to a recent desire to surf the internet using my LCIII I went on a quest to find the best 68k browser I could download. Unfortunately for a 68k mac this ended up being a tossup between Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.08.</p>
		<h2>Internet Explorer 4 vs Netscape 4</h2>
		<p> The machine in Question? A clock chipped LCIII with 20 Mb of Ram and a SCSI2 SD replacement 4gb hard drive running 7.6.1.</p>

		<p>In the end Even though Explorer offers a better layout engine and faster load times, I end up using netscape due to the fact that it seems to load anything eventually rather than failing most of the time. Would it be nice if we could just make it support SSL and speed it up a little?</p>
		<p>Well maybe we can...</p>
		<h2>Building the Source</h2>
		<p>This is proving to be more difficult than I had expected. Finding the source was relatively easy. The march 31, 1998 release is available from mozilla in a source archive here: <a href="https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/source/">Mozilla Source Archive</a>.</p>
		<p>I downloaded the mozilla-19980331-mac.sit.bin file on my Macbook and then copied it into a SheepShaver Instance running Mac OS 9.0.4. The sheepshaver instance uncompressed it alright and then I found the build instructions located in the archive at "MacMozillaSource:Build Documentation:macbuild.htm" (Classic mac os paths are delimited by colons).</p>
		<p>I've uploaded the build instructions here: <a href="macbuild.htm">macbuild.htm</a></p>
		<p>The build instructions were longer than I expected, I had hoped for something that just had me running a few commands in MPW but it turns out Mozilla for classic mac os required CodeWarrior AND MPW to build. And the build is launched by its own executable. To make things worse, the source isn't even complete, it has almost a dozen dependencies that need to be obtained before it can be built...</p>
		<p> I started by looking for a copy of codewarrior, Fortunately this was relatively easy to obtain, as the <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/">Macintosh Garden</a> had both Codewarrior Pro 3 and Pro 4. After Installing Codewarrior 3 in Sheepshaver, I set out to download the dependancies described in the build instructions. Pretty much every link in macbuild.htm was broken, so it seems that most of these dependencies have long vanished from the internet. After several days of combing <a href="archive.org"> The Internet Archive </a> and posting on <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3246/trying-to-build-first-mozilla-release-netscape-5"> Stack Exchnage: Retrocomputing </a> I've been abe to obtain all the dependencies... But not all of the tools.... Here's what I've found.</p>

			<p> In Short, this project is stalled until I can get ahold of a copy of the Develop 25 cd from apple... I'll try the 68k mla forums next... If anyone has it, post to the retrocomputing thread <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3246/trying-to-build-first-mozilla-release-netscape-5">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Update: I managed to get ahold of the develop 26 cd on ebay, my understanding is that it should also contain all of the build tools that were supplied on the develop 25 cd, but we will see. It should arrive in about a week.</strong></p>
		<p> One of the guys on the 68kmla forums came through and got me not only ToolFrontEnd but everything that was Distributed with Develop 25. I've added the sit file as a link above.</p>
