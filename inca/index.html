		<h1>Cameleon / Three Way Kit No 7010 Manual</h1>
		<p> So my mother gave my wife this loom, and my wife misplaced the instructions. Naturally she searched for the instructions on the internet, bu was unable to find them. I was feeling particularly enterprising this night so I started trying to figure out how to put the loom together, but wasn't getting anywhere, then she walks in with the instrutions that she found in a box somewhere. Figuring someone else might be in this situation, I decided to scan and upload them.</p>
