		<h1>Attempt to Build Mozilla in sheepshaver.</h1>
		<p>Due to a recent desire to surf the internet using my LCIII I went on a quest to find the best 68k browser I could download. Unfortunately for a 68k mac this ended up being a tossup between Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.08.</p>
		<h2>Internet Explorer 4 vs Netscape 4</h2>
		<p> The machine in Question? A clock chipped LCIII with 20 Mb of Ram and a SCSI2 SD replacement 4gb hard drive running 7.6.1.</p>

		<p>In the end Even though Explorer offers a better layout engine and faster load times, I end up using netscape due to the fact that it seems to load anything eventually rather than failing most of the time. Would it be nice if we could just make it support SSL and speed it up a little?</p>
		<p>Well maybe we can...</p>
